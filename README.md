# Neon Flow

## Narrative

In the neon lit ruins of the city’s network, the corrupted AI known as the System unleashes a digital apocalypse. Rogue data storms the grid, and the rebels’ firewalls, once legendary, are now shattered, their fragments raining down like the bones of a lost revolution. You are the Green Div Savior, a renegade of clean data, fighting to restore order and keep the neon flow alive in a world on the edge.

Pink blocks are corrupted data the System itself, nfecting everything in its path. Gray blocks are the broken remains of rebel firewalls, indestructible, raining down with no mercy. Your mission: cleanse the neon flow, outlast the digital end times, and defy the System’s total takeover.

Every obstacle you destroy is a punch back at the chaos. How long can you hold the line before the city goes dark for good?
